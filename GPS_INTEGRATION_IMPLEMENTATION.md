- ✅ Signal quality clearly displayed with color-coded indicators
- ✅ Accuracy values shown in meters with marine navigation standards
- ✅ Signal strength categories (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor/Unknown)
- ✅ Marine-grade status indicators (✓ for suitable, ⚠ for unsuitable)
- ✅ Real-time updates with confidence levels

#### Vessel Position Overlay on Charts
- ✅ Vessel position accurately overlaid on maritime charts
- ✅ Red circle with white outline for high visibility
- ✅ GPS accuracy circle showing position uncertainty
- ✅ Responsive to chart zoom and pan operations
- ✅ Only renders when position is within visible chart area

#### Heading and Course Over Ground Display
- ✅ Heading properly calculated and displayed with compass
- ✅ Course over ground calculated from position history
- ✅ Heading arrow on vessel position overlay
- ✅ Traditional marine compass display with north indicator
- ✅ Confidence levels for calculated navigation values

#### GPS Data Logging and Track Recording
- ✅ Comprehensive track data captured automatically
- ✅ Position history with timestamps and accuracy data
- ✅ Track statistics: distance, speed, duration, position count
- ✅ Marine-grade position percentage tracking
- ✅ Track clearing and management functionality

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- Uses Riverpod for reactive state management
- Stream-based providers for real-time GPS updates
- Family providers for time-window-based queries
- Proper error handling and loading states

### Marine Navigation Standards
- 10-meter accuracy threshold for marine-grade positioning
- Nautical coordinate format display (degrees, minutes, decimal minutes)
- Speed in knots, distances in nautical miles/meters
- Traditional marine compass conventions (0° = North)
- Position logging suitable for maritime use cases

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient CustomPaint rendering for vessel overlay
- Position history size limits (1000 positions max)
- Smart stream management to prevent memory leaks
- Conditional rendering based on chart visibility
- Optimized coordinate transformations

### Platform Support
- Cross-platform GPS service (Windows uses Win32, others use geolocator)
- Responsive UI design for different screen sizes
- Desktop-optimized interactions and layouts
- Proper resource cleanup and lifecycle management

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **GPS Providers**: Tests for all provider functionality including position streams, signal quality, and vessel tracking
- **GPS Widgets**: Widget tests for status indicators, rendering, and user interactions
- Mock GPS service integration for reliable testing
- Coverage of error conditions and edge cases

### Integration Testing
Current GPS service already has comprehensive integration tests. New UI components integrate with existing tested backend services.

### Files Modified
- `lib/features/charts/chart_widget.dart` - Added vessel position overlay
- `lib/features/charts/chart_screen.dart` - Added GPS status integration
- `lib/core/state/providers.dart` - Added GPS provider imports

## Usage Examples

### Basic GPS Status Display
```dart
// Compact GPS indicator for toolbars
CompactGpsStatusIndicator()

// Detailed GPS status panel
DetailedGpsStatusPanel()
```

### Chart with Vessel Position
```dart
ChartWidget(
  showVesselPosition: true,
  showVesselTrack: true,
  showVesselHeading: true,
  // ... other chart parameters
)
```

### Navigation Instruments
```dart
// Full navigation instrument panel
NavigationInstruments()

// Compact version for limited space
NavigationInstruments(isCompact: true)
```

### GPS Data Access
```dart
// Get current GPS position
final position = ref.watch(latestGpsPositionProvider);

// Get vessel track history
final track = ref.watch(vesselTrackProvider(Duration(hours: 1)));

// Check if GPS is marine-grade
final isMarineGrade = ref.watch(isMarineGradeGpsProvider);
```

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation fully satisfies issue #27, potential future improvements could include:

1. **Advanced Track Analysis**: Speed profiles, acceleration patterns, anchoring detection
2. **Chart Centering**: Automatic chart centering on vessel position
3. **Waypoint Navigation**: Integration with route planning for turn-by-turn navigation
4. **AIS Integration**: Display of other vessels with GPS-style overlays
5. **GPS Logging Export**: Export track data in standard maritime formats (GPX, KML)

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete GPS integration solution for NavTool that meets all requirements specified in issue #27. The architecture is designed to be maintainable, performant, and extensible while adhering to marine navigation standards and best practices.

The GPS integration transforms NavTool from a static chart viewer into a fully functional marine navigation system with real-time positioning, comprehensive status monitoring, and professional-grade navigation instruments suitable for maritime use.
