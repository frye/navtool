NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 10.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, WA, or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


COLREGS, 80.1395 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. 
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet 
from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at 
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html  and  https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html . 


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


REGULATED NAVIGATION AREA
A Regulated Navigation Area has been established by the U.S. Coast Guard.
Please see Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10 or 33 CFR 165.1301 and 33 CFR
165.1303.
