///
/// These tests verify that the abstract interface is properly defined
/// and can be implemented correctly. They focus on:
/// - Method signature validation
/// - Return type verification
/// - Interface compliance checking
/// - Type safety validation
///
/// **Test Categories:**
/// - Interface definition tests
/// - Method signature validation
/// - Return type compliance
/// - Callback type verification
///
/// **Note:** Implementation-specific behavior is tested in the
/// corresponding implementation test files.
