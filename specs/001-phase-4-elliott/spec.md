## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable loading time before the user must see a progress indicator? ‚Üí A: Fast (< 500ms) - Show indicator only if loading exceeds half second. This threshold must be easily configurable (constant/configuration value) for adjustment prior to compilation.
- Q: After max retries are exhausted, what actions should be available to the user? ‚Üí A: Retry + Dismiss - User can manually retry the same chart load operation or dismiss the error to browse other charts.
- Q: How are expected integrity hashes initially populated in the registry? ‚Üí A: First-load capture - System captures and stores the hash on first successful load of each chart for future verification.
- Q: What diagnostic information must be logged when chart loading fails? ‚Üí A: Minimal by default (error type and chart ID only), Comprehensive when debug output is enabled at application launch (includes stack traces, file paths, hash values, extraction details, system state).
- Q: What should happen if a user attempts to load multiple charts simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Queue - Load requests are queued and processed sequentially to ensure resource management and integrity verification reliability.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a marine navigator, when I load Elliott Bay nautical charts into NavTool, I need confidence that the chart data is authentic and uncorrupted, and I need the system to recover gracefully from temporary loading failures without manual intervention.

**Value Proposition**: Safety-critical marine navigation requires verified chart data integrity and resilient loading processes to prevent navigational errors that could endanger vessels.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Chart Integrity Verification
1. **Given** a user attempts to load an Elliott Bay chart from a ZIP file
2. **When** the chart data's digital signature does not match the expected integrity hash
3. **Then** the system MUST display a clear error message indicating data integrity mismatch
4. **And** the system MUST provide troubleshooting guidance for the user
5. **And** the system MUST prevent the corrupted chart from being used for navigation

#### Scenario 2: Transient Loading Failure Recovery
1. **Given** a user attempts to load an Elliott Bay chart
2. **When** the chart parser encounters a temporary failure (e.g., resource contention, memory pressure)
3. **Then** the system MUST automatically retry the loading operation
4. **And** the system MUST use exponential backoff between retry attempts
5. **And** the system MUST succeed when the transient condition clears
6. **And** the user MUST see loading progress without manual intervention

#### Scenario 3: Successful Chart Loading from ZIP
1. **Given** a user has a valid Elliott Bay chart ZIP file (US5WA50M_harbor_elliott_bay.zip)
2. **When** the user initiates chart loading
3. **Then** the system MUST extract the .000 dataset file from the ZIP archive
4. **And** the system MUST handle various NOAA ZIP layouts (root, ENC_ROOT/*, nested folders)
5. **And** the system MUST verify integrity after extraction
6. **And** the system MUST display the loaded chart with all features

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** the ZIP file contains multiple chart datasets?
  - System MUST identify and extract the correct .000 cell file for the requested chart ID
- **What happens when** transient failures persist beyond retry attempts?
  - System MUST display a clear failure message after exhausting retry attempts
- **What happens when** the ZIP file structure doesn't match known NOAA patterns?
  - System MUST attempt multiple known path patterns before failing
- **What happens when** the integrity hash is missing from the registry?
  - System MUST load the chart, capture and store its hash for future verification, and inform the user this is the first load (no prior hash to verify against)
- **What happens when** a user attempts to load multiple charts simultaneously?
  - System MUST queue load requests and process them sequentially, displaying queue position or status to the user

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Chart Integrity Validation
- **FR-001**: System MUST verify chart data integrity using cryptographic hash comparison (SHA256)
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain a registry of expected integrity hashes for known charts, capturing and storing the hash on first successful load of each chart
- **FR-002a**: On first load of a chart (no existing hash in registry), system MUST capture the SHA256 hash and persist it for future verification
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect when extracted chart data does not match expected integrity hash
- **FR-004**: System MUST display user-friendly error messages when integrity mismatch is detected
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide troubleshooting guidance for integrity failures
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent navigation use of charts with failed integrity verification

#### Transient Failure Recovery
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically retry chart loading when transient parser failures occur
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement exponential backoff between retry attempts (e.g., 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms)
- **FR-009**: System MUST limit total retry attempts to prevent infinite loops (max 4 retries)
- **FR-010**: System MUST display loading progress indicator during retry attempts
- **FR-011**: System MUST succeed and display the chart when transient condition clears
- **FR-012**: System MUST report failure after exhausting retry attempts with user options to: (1) manually retry the operation, or (2) dismiss the error and return to chart browser

#### ZIP Extraction Robustness
- **FR-013**: System MUST extract NOAA ENC chart datasets from ZIP archives
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle multiple common NOAA ZIP layouts (root directory, ENC_ROOT/*, nested chart-id folders)
- **FR-015**: System MUST perform case-insensitive file matching within ZIP archives
- **FR-016**: System MUST locate and extract .000 cell files for requested chart IDs
- **FR-017**: System MUST return extracted chart data bytes for subsequent parsing
- **FR-018**: System MUST report clear errors when chart dataset cannot be located in ZIP

#### User Feedback
- **FR-019**: System MUST display loading overlay with progress indicator within 500ms if chart loading operation is still in progress
- **FR-019a**: The 500ms progress indicator threshold MUST be easily adjustable via configuration constant before compilation
- **FR-020**: System MUST display specific error messages for different failure types (integrity, parsing, extraction)
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide actionable troubleshooting suggestions for each error type
- **FR-022**: System MUST allow users to dismiss error messages and return to chart browser

#### Observability and Diagnostics
- **FR-023**: System MUST log minimal diagnostic information on chart loading failures in normal operation (error type and chart ID)
- **FR-024**: System MUST support a debug output mode that can be enabled at application launch
- **FR-025**: When debug mode is enabled, system MUST log comprehensive diagnostics including: error type, chart ID, timestamp, retry attempts, file paths, hash values, extraction details, stack traces, and relevant system state

#### Concurrency Management
- **FR-026**: System MUST queue multiple chart load requests and process them sequentially
- **FR-027**: System MUST display queue position or loading status when multiple load operations are pending

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Chart Data**: Raw binary data representing a nautical chart in S-57 format, extracted from ZIP archives and verified for integrity before parsing
- **Integrity Hash**: SHA256 cryptographic hash value expected for a specific chart dataset, used to verify data authenticity
- **Chart Load Error**: Structured error information categorizing failure types (integrity mismatch, parser failure, extraction failure) with associated troubleshooting guidance
- **Chart Integrity Registry**: In-memory collection mapping chart identifiers to expected integrity hashes, seeded for testing and production use
- **ZIP Archive**: Compressed file containing NOAA ENC chart datasets, potentially with nested directory structures

- Existing S-57 parser components
- Test fixtures: `test/fixtures/charts/noaa_enc/US5WA50M_harbor_elliott_bay.zip`
- Widget testing framework and UI instrumentation

### Assumptions

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this feature:

- Network-based chart downloads (this feature focuses on loading from local ZIP files)
- Chart rendering improvements (feature displays charts, doesn't change rendering)
- Support for non-NOAA chart formats
- Automatic chart updates or synchronization
- Performance optimization beyond retry logic
- Chart data caching or persistence strategies
