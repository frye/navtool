   ‚Üí Actions: Run tests, generate mocks, complete test execution
   ‚Üí Data: Test results, mock files, CI logs
   ‚Üí Constraints: Tests must complete within reasonable time, mocks must generate successfully
3. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Test execution must complete without hanging
   ‚Üí Mock generation must succeed in CI environment
4. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Tests must not hang or become stuck
   ‚Üí Mock generation must complete successfully
   ‚Üí CI workflows must execute without manual intervention
5. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Test files with mock dependencies
   ‚Üí Build runner configuration

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on NavTool, I need the test suite to run to completion without hanging, and the mock generation process to succeed both locally and in CI, so that I can validate code changes and merge pull requests without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer runs the chart browser screen tests locally, **When** the test suite executes, **Then** all tests complete within 15 minutes without hanging or requiring manual interruption

2. **Given** a CI workflow runs unit tests, **When** the mock generation step executes, **Then** all mock files are generated successfully without build_runner errors

3. **Given** tests are executing with complex UI interactions, **When** tests involve filtering controls or asynchronous operations, **Then** tests wait appropriately for UI state changes and complete successfully

4. **Given** a developer runs the full test suite, **When** test execution begins, **Then** progress is visible and tests do not become stuck in an infinite loop

### Edge Cases
- What happens when test execution involves multiple async operations that don't complete?
- How does the system handle test timeouts that are too short for complex marine UI interactions?
- What happens when mock generation encounters circular dependencies or missing annotations?
- How does the system detect and report tests that are genuinely stuck versus tests that are legitimately slow?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Test Execution**
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST complete execution within a defined timeout period (15 minutes for chart browser tests)
- **FR-002**: Tests MUST NOT hang or become stuck waiting for UI state changes indefinitely
- **FR-003**: Test execution MUST provide visible progress indicators to show tests are running
- **FR-004**: Tests with complex UI interactions MUST use appropriate wait strategies that account for marine navigation UI complexity

**Mock Generation**
- **FR-005**: Mock generation process MUST complete successfully both locally and in CI environments
- **FR-006**: Build runner MUST generate all required mock files without errors
- **FR-007**: Mock generation errors MUST provide clear diagnostic information about the failure cause
- **FR-008**: Mock generation MUST handle all @GenerateMocks annotations correctly

**CI Integration**
- **FR-009**: GitHub Actions workflows MUST execute test runs without manual intervention
- **FR-010**: CI failures due to stuck tests MUST be detectable and reportable within the timeout period
- **FR-011**: Mock generation failures in CI MUST fail fast with clear error messages

**Developer Experience**
- **FR-012**: Developers MUST be able to run tests locally with the same reliability as CI
- **FR-013**: Test failures MUST be reproducible and debuggable
- **FR-014**: Test execution MUST not require manual interruption (Ctrl+C) to terminate

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Files**: Dart test files that use @GenerateMocks annotations and execute UI widget tests
- **Mock Files**: Generated .mocks.dart files containing mock implementations
- **Build Configuration**: build_runner and mockito configuration in pubspec.yaml
- **CI Workflows**: GitHub Actions workflow files that run tests and generate mocks
- **Test Timeouts**: Timeout configurations for test execution and async operations

## Additional Context

### Problem Statement
The chart browser screen test suite contains tests that hang during execution, requiring manual interruption. Specifically:
- Tests get stuck after reaching "should show date filtering controls when enabled"
- The test never completes the "should filter charts by scale range" test
- Developer had to use Ctrl+C to interrupt the test run

Additionally, CI workflows fail during the mock generation phase with build_runner errors, preventing successful test execution in automated environments.

### Business Impact
- Developers cannot validate chart browser functionality changes
- CI/CD pipeline is blocked for pull requests
- Development velocity is reduced due to unreliable test execution
- Code quality checks cannot be automated effectively
- Manual testing becomes necessary, increasing risk of defects

### Success Criteria
1. All chart browser screen tests execute to completion without hanging
2. Test suite completes within 15 minutes (current timeout period)
3. Mock generation succeeds in all environments (local, CI)
4. CI workflows run without manual intervention
5. Test failures are clear, reproducible, and debuggable
6. No tests require Ctrl+C interruption to terminate

### Out of Scope
- Refactoring the entire test suite architecture
- Changing the testing framework or mock generation library
- Modifying the chart browser screen UI implementation
- Performance optimization of test execution speed beyond ensuring completion
