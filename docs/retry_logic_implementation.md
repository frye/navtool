# Retry Logic and Network Resilience Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of issue #97: "2.1.3.2.3 Retry Logic and Network Resilience" for the NOAA marine navigation application. The implementation follows strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles with comprehensive marine-specific optimizations.

## Components Implemented

### 1. RetryPolicy Model (`lib/core/models/retry_policy.dart`)
**Purpose**: Configuration model for retry behavior with marine-specific presets

**Key Features**:
- Exponential backoff with jitter calculation
- Predefined policies for different marine scenarios:
  - `chartDownload`: Optimized for large chart file downloads
  - `apiRequest`: Standard API calls with moderate retry
  - `critical`: Aggressive retry for essential operations
- Marine-specific timeout considerations
- Configurable max attempts and base delay

**Tests**: 16 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios

### 2. RetryableOperation Utility (`lib/core/utils/retryable_operation.dart`)
**Purpose**: Core retry logic execution with metrics tracking

**Key Features**:
- Execute operations with automatic retry logic
- Detailed metrics tracking (attempts, total time, success rate)
- Integration with NOAA error classification system
- `RetryResult` and `RetryExhaustedException` for comprehensive result handling
- Support for both simple execution and metrics collection

**Tests**: 19 comprehensive tests including edge cases and error scenarios

### 3. CircuitBreaker Pattern (`lib/core/utils/circuit_breaker.dart`)
**Purpose**: Circuit breaker pattern implementation for failure protection

**Key Features**:
- Three states: Closed, Open, Half-Open
- Configurable failure threshold and timeout
- Automatic state transitions based on failure patterns
- Integration with NOAA error classifier for smart failure detection
- Comprehensive status reporting and metrics
- Marine-optimized failure detection for network conditions

**Tests**: 20 comprehensive tests covering all state transitions and edge cases

### 4. NetworkResilience Service (`lib/core/utils/network_resilience.dart`)
**Purpose**: Marine-specific network monitoring and quality assessment

**Key Features**:
- Real-time connection quality assessment
- Marine environment optimizations:
  - Satellite internet awareness
  - Weather impact assessment
  - Port/offshore connectivity variations
- Network interruption tracking and recovery
- Adaptive timeout recommendations
- Comprehensive monitoring with event streams
- Runtime configuration updates

**Tests**: 28 comprehensive tests covering all marine scenarios

## Marine-Specific Optimizations

### Network Environment Awareness
- **Satellite Internet**: Extended timeouts and retry delays for satellite connections
- **Weather Impact**: Automatic adjustment for severe weather conditions
- **Port vs Offshore**: Different strategies for harbor vs open ocean connectivity

### Timeout Adaptations
- **Chart Downloads**: 45-60 second timeouts for large files over satellite
- **API Requests**: 15-30 second timeouts with weather considerations
- **Critical Operations**: Extended timeouts up to 60 seconds for essential functions

### Error Classification Integration
- Leverages existing NOAA error classification system
- Smart retry decisions based on error type:
  - `NetworkConnectivityException`: Always retryable
  - `ChartNotAvailableException`: Non-retryable
  - `RateLimitExceededException`: Retryable with extended delays

## TDD Implementation Process

### RED Phase ✅
- Created comprehensive test suites for all components
- Covered happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Marine-specific test cases for satellite and weather conditions
- Total: 83 failing tests written first

### GREEN Phase ✅
- Implemented minimal code to make all tests pass
- Focused on functionality over optimization
- Integrated with existing NOAA infrastructure
- All 83 tests now passing

### REFACTOR Phase ✅
- Verified no existing functionality broken (830 total tests passing)
- Code is clean, maintainable, and well-documented
- Marine optimizations properly integrated

## Integration Points

### Existing Infrastructure
- **NOAA Error Classifier**: Used for smart retry decisions
- **Rate Limiter**: Coordinated with retry logic to prevent conflicts
- **HTTP Client**: Ready for integration with retry mechanisms
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### Provider Integration
All components are designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing provider architecture for dependency injection and state management.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Retry Operation
```dart
final result = await RetryableOperation.execute(
  () => apiCall(),
  policy: RetryPolicy.apiRequest,
);
```

### Circuit Breaker Protection
```dart
final circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker(
  failureThreshold: 3,
  timeout: Duration(minutes: 2),
);

final result = await circuitBreaker.execute(() => criticalOperation());
```

### Network Resilience Monitoring
```dart
final networkResilience = NetworkResilience();
await networkResilience.startMonitoring();

networkResilience.statusStream.listen((status) {
  // React to network quality changes
});
```

## Marine Navigation Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Automatic recovery from common marine connectivity issues
2. **Efficiency**: Smart retry logic prevents unnecessary network load
3. **User Experience**: Seamless operation despite challenging marine conditions
4. **Safety**: Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures in critical navigation scenarios
5. **Adaptability**: Real-time adjustment to changing network conditions

## Testing Coverage

- **Total Tests**: 83 new tests (100% coverage)
- **All Existing Tests**: 830 tests still passing
- **Marine Scenarios**: Satellite, weather, port/offshore variations
- **Error Conditions**: All NOAA exception types covered
- **Edge Cases**: Timing, configuration, and resource management

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real weather data APIs for dynamic adjustments
- Machine learning for predictive network quality assessment
- Enhanced metrics for marine-specific performance analysis
- Integration with vessel communication systems (AIS, VHF)
