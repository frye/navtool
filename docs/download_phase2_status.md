## ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation Consolidated

This status document has been merged into the comprehensive architectural reference:
**üìã See: [`docs/download_resume_integrity_architecture.md`](download_resume_integrity_architecture.md)**

The architecture document now contains:
- Complete implementation status and checklist
- Detailed technical architecture
- Test coverage summary  
- Known limitations and future roadmap
- Operational considerations
- Phase 2 completion summary

## Quick Reference (Historical)

Phase 2 focused on robust resumable downloads and integrity safeguards for chart packages under intermittent / high-latency marine network conditions. ### Core Goals Achieved:
- ‚úÖ Detect & leverage HTTP Range support
- ‚úÖ Preserve and append partial downloads safely
- ‚úÖ Add adaptive retry with jitter
- ‚úÖ Persist richer resume diagnostics (attempt counts, range support, last error code)
- ‚úÖ Preflight disk space (best effort heuristic)
- ‚úÖ Sweep stale / invalid resume metadata
- ‚úÖ Provide structured error codes for failure analytics

**All objectives complete.** Future enhancements tracked as Phase 3 candidates in the main architecture document.

## Archive: Original Checklist (Completed)

- [x] Extend `ResumeData` with `supportsRange`, `attempts`, `lastErrorCode` field placeholders
- [x] Range support probe (`_probeRangeSupport`)
- [x] Manual append resume streaming (`_appendResumeStream`)
- [x] Exponential retry + jitter inside `_downloadWithRetry`
- [x] Persist actual partial bytes on failure path
- [x] Disk space preflight heuristic (`_hasSufficientDiskSpace`)
- [x] Pass initial Phase 2 feature tests (range probe, manual append, jitter, disk space rejection)
- [x] Stale resume cleanup (remove/normalize orphan, mismatch, completed, zero-length scenarios)
- [x] Structured `lastErrorCode` population (checksum_mismatch, insufficient_disk_space, network_timeout, network, storage, unknown)
- [x] Load-time proactive invalid resume sweep (runs after `_loadPersistentState`)
- [x] Additional tests: stale cleanup, error code mapping, checksum mismatch scenario
- [x] Documentation: Consolidated into comprehensive architecture guide
