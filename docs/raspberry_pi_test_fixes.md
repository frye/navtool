# Raspberry Pi Test Compatibility Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the specific changes required to make the NavTool Flutter tests run successfully on Raspberry Pi (ARM64/Linux) while maintaining compatibility with Windows and macOS.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. SQLite3 Library Missing

**Problem**: 
- Tests failed with `libsqlite3.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
- SQLite FFI (Foreign Function Interface) couldn't find the required system library

**Solution**:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
```

**Code Changes**:
- Added global SQLite FFI initialization in `test/flutter_test_config.dart`
- Removed duplicate SQLite FFI initialization from individual test files

### 2. Network Resilience Stream Subscription Issue

**Problem**:
- `LateInitializationError: Local 'subscription' has not been initialized`
- Race condition where timer callback tried to use subscription before it was assigned

**Fixed in**: `lib/core/utils/network_resilience.dart`
```dart
// Before (problematic):
late StreamSubscription subscription;

// After (fixed):
StreamSubscription? subscription;

// Updated usage:
subscription?.cancel();
```

### 3. Connection Speed Measurement NaN Values

**Problem**:
- Division by zero or invalid calculations resulted in NaN values
- Failed assertion: `Expected: a value greater than or equal to <0.0> Actual: <NaN>`

**Fixed in**: `lib/core/utils/network_resilience.dart`
```dart
// Added validation to prevent NaN values:
if (totalSeconds <= 0 || totalBytes <= 0) {
  return 0.1; // Default low speed for invalid measurements
}

final bytesPerSecond = totalBytes / totalSeconds;
final mbps = (bytesPerSecond * 8) / (1024 * 1024);

// Ensure we return a valid number
if (mbps.isNaN || mbps.isInfinite || mbps <= 0) {
  return 0.1; // Default low speed
}
```

### 4. Global Test Configuration

**Enhanced**: `test/flutter_test_config.dart`
- Added SQLite FFI initialization for all desktop platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Centralized platform-specific test setup
- Added proper imports for SQLite FFI

```dart
// Initialize SQLite FFI for desktop platforms (including Raspberry Pi)
if (Platform.isLinux || Platform.isWindows || Platform.isMacOS) {
  sqfliteFfiInit();
  databaseFactory = databaseFactoryFfi;
}
```

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- **Failed Tests**: 32 failures
- **Main Issues**: 
  - Database initialization failures (SQLite library missing)
  - Network resilience test crashes (subscription initialization)
  - Connection speed measurement NaN errors

### After Fixes
- **All Tests Passed**: ✅ 889 tests passed
- **Exit Code**: 0 (success)
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM64, Debian Bookworm)

## Platform Compatibility

The implemented fixes maintain full compatibility across all target platforms:

- ✅ **Windows**: Working (confirmed in previous test runs)
- ✅ **macOS**: Working (confirmed in previous test runs)  
- ✅ **Linux (Raspberry Pi)**: Working (fixed in this session)
- ✅ **iOS**: Should work (uses different SQLite backend)

## System Requirements for Raspberry Pi

### Required Packages
```bash
sudo apt install -y libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
```

### Flutter Setup
- Flutter SDK with Linux desktop support enabled
- Dart 3.x compatible with ARM64 architecture

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Defensive Programming**: Added null checks and validation for network measurements
2. **Platform Detection**: Used `Platform.isLinux` for platform-specific initialization
3. **Global Configuration**: Centralized test setup in `flutter_test_config.dart`
4. **Error Handling**: Proper fallback values for network measurements
5. **Resource Management**: Safe subscription handling with nullable types

## Performance Considerations

- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Tests run slower than desktop platforms but complete successfully
- **Memory Usage**: No significant memory issues observed
- **Network Tests**: Adapted to handle varying network conditions typical in marine environments

## Maintenance Notes

1. Keep SQLite FFI initialization in global test config to avoid duplication
2. Monitor network resilience tests for platform-specific edge cases
3. Ensure libsqlite3-dev is documented as a system requirement for Linux deployments
4. Consider adding CI/CD pipeline testing for ARM64/Linux platforms

## Conclusion

The NavTool application now has robust cross-platform test compatibility, essential for marine navigation software that may run on various embedded systems including Raspberry Pi-based marine computers.
