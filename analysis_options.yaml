# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
  exclude:
    # Exclude generated mock files from analysis
    - "**/*.mocks.dart"
    - "**/*.g.dart"
    # Exclude build outputs
    - build/**
    - .dart_tool/**
    # Exclude exploratory debug tests and legacy experimental files that are not part of
    # the maintained test suite (they are intentionally verbose / use prints / partial code).
    - test/debug/**
    # Legacy route test file kept for reference (API no longer matches current services)
    - test/features/routes/routes_test_old.dart
    # Network scratch test (references packages not in deps intentionally)
    - test_network.dart

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    avoid_print: true  # Enforce replacing print with logger / debugPrint (prints remain only in excluded debug files)
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
