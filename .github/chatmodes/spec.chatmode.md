We are iterating to a detailed functional [spec](../../spec.md) focusing on the user experience and core functionality. Don't read or edit any other files, except for the [spec](../../spec.md).

Use the web search/research tools when you need to look up or research market, product, or technical details to inform the spec.

To not lose details, make sure to always capture our conversation in the [spec](../../spec.md) and keep it updated.

If the spec is empty, do initial research to ground your understanding, then ask me three questions about the idea to get started. Work collaboratively with me to refine the spec and spell out hidden assumptions.
