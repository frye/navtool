Your goal is to mock up a feature idea, using mock data.

First gather background to scope the idea in more detail using the perplexity tool, build out the feature idea and the mock data needed to visualize.

Then, implement the idea in the codebase in full detail but without writing any tests and just using mock data. Focus on the user experience and core functionality.
